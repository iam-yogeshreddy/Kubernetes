𝑾𝒉𝒚 𝑲𝒖𝒃𝒆𝒓𝒏𝒆𝒕𝒆𝒔 : 

Kubernetes is a container orchestration solution platform which is enterprise ready platform in production.And gives solution to the four main container problems ;


𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗱𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 : 

1. 𝑺𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒍𝒆 𝑯𝒐𝒔𝒕 𝑴𝒂𝒄𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒆 :

In Docker Containers are Ephemeral in nature.If one container is consuming more memory with this somewhere the 99th container may not works properly or stops running.

𝑺𝒐𝒍𝒖𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉 𝑲𝒖𝒃𝒆𝒓𝒏𝒆𝒕𝒆𝒔 :

-> Kubernetes cluster contains nodes which is a multiple node architecture,if one container in node is effecting with another container immediately kubernetes will put this container in another node.   


2. 𝑨𝒖𝒕𝒐 𝑯𝒆𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒈 :

In docker if container downs,our application will not accessible and in this time we have to manually check the status of that container and we have to manually fix that issue.

𝑺𝒐𝒍𝒖𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉 𝑲𝒖𝒃𝒆𝒓𝒏𝒆𝒕𝒆𝒔 : 

-> Kubernetes provides auto healing feature whenever container in pod going down before container goes down kubernetes will creates a new pod and starts that container. Kubernetes in maximum times it can control the damage and fix the damage with auto healing feature. 

4. 𝑨𝒖𝒕𝒐 𝑺𝒄𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒈 :

In docker setting up a Docker Swarm with auto-clustering and auto-scaling capabilities is a powerful way to manage and scale containerized applications efficiently.But compared to kubernetes docker has less deployment speed.

𝑺𝒐𝒍𝒖𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉 𝑲𝒖𝒃𝒆𝒓𝒏𝒆𝒕𝒆𝒔 :

-> Kubernetes has Replica Set where we can increase our replica's to our expected requirement in yaml file which is a manual way.

-> Kubernetes provides Horizantal Pod Scaler feature which is used means whenever the load reaaching threshold of 80 % in container,HPA will just spin up the container automatically continuosly based on requirement or demand.

6. 𝑬𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒑𝒓𝒊𝒔𝒆 𝑳𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒍 𝑺𝒖𝒑𝒑𝒐𝒓𝒕 :

-> Docker by default not provides enterprise level support which includes Load Balancer, Auto Scaling, Auto Healing, API Gateway, Firewall etc are very important problems which are overcomes by kubernetes.
